# neuro-forge: reproducible provisioning of neuroimaging workspaces for image processing and data analysis

This project contains everything needed to build and update the neuro-forge packages. neuro-forge is a set of packages for the Conda ecosystem dedicated to image analysis and data analysis in neuroimaging. The URL for neuro-forge channel is https://brainvisa.info/neuro-forge.

neuro-forge is still in early alpha stage and should only be used for testing.

## Prerequisite
Most action with neuro-forge requires to [install Pixi](https://pixi.sh). Pixi is a package manager fully compatible with Conda packages ecosystem but, at the time of this writing, much more efficient than Conda.

# How to create a workspace directory and install neuro-forge packages

neuro-forge packages are contained in a Conda channel located in https://brainvisa.info/neuro-forge. They can be installed using [Pixi](https://pixi.sh), [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io) or [Conda](https://docs.conda.io). We recommend the use of pixi. For instance, once pixi is installed, one can use the following script to setup a workspace containing anatomist:

## Without CUDA in PyTorch:

```
# Create a workspace directory
mkdir ~/workspace

# Setup workspace
cd ~/workspace
pixi init -c https://brainvisa.info/neuro-forge -c conda-forge

# Enter workspace
pixi shell

# Install anatomist
pixi add anatomist

# Run anatomist
anatomist
```

## With PyTorch + CUDA

This variant adds pytorch and nvida channels, and needs a bit of config tweaking to avoid conflicts between packages provided by these added channels. Thus, it is a bit more complex. By the way we also add a pipy package. Note that this added complexity is not due to Neuro-forge or BrainVisa packages, but just to enable the added channels to work well together (and, yes, with Neuro-forge packages).

```
# Create a workspace directory
mkdir ~/workspace

# Setup workspace
cd ~/workspace
pixi init -c https://brainvisa.info/neuro-forge -c pytorch -c nvidia -c conda-forge

echo 'soma-env = ">=0.0"' >> pixi.toml
echo 'libjpeg-turbo = {channel= "conda-forge", version= ">=3.0"}' >> pixi.toml
echo "" >> pixi.toml
echo "[pypi-dependencies]" >> pixi.toml
echo 'dracopy = ">=1.4.2"' >> pixi.toml

# Enter workspace
pixi shell

# Install anatomist
pixi add anatomist

# Run anatomist
anatomist
```

# How to create packages for neuro-forge channel

Neuro-forge is currently maintained by [Neurospin GAIA team](https://neurospin.github.io/gaia/). The only way to add/modify/remove a package from [neuro-forge channel](https://brainvisa.info/neuro-forge) is to modify the neuro-forge channel directory which is a clone of the published channel located in Neurospin. Modification to this directory is allowed to packages maintainer. The neuro-forge channel directory is synchronized to [neuro-forge channel](https://brainvisa.info/neuro-forge) when modified.

If you wish to participate to neuro-forge, you can contact [the BrainVISA team](mailto:admin@brainvisa.info).

## Package creation

The creation of packages for neuro-forge is based on the use of [rattler-build](https://prefix-dev.github.io/rattler-build). Each package is created by writing a recipe that is used by rattler-build to create the final package file. The neuro-forge channel is composed of three kinds of recipes:

- [Standard recipes](https://github.com/neurospin/neuro-forge/tree/main/recipes) that are standard rattler-build recipes that are git compatible (i.e. composed of, at most, a few text file) and can be built independently using only dependencies from standard channels such as conda-forge and bioconda.
- Internal recipes that are located in the neuro-forge directory in Neurospin. Packages are put here either because they are too big (some packages requires several giga bytes of data) or because the recipe is not public.
- [soma-forge recipes](https://github.com/neurospin/neuro-forge/tree/main/soma-forge) that are used to create packages for the [BrainVISA](https://brainvisa.info) project. Most of these packages are compiled ; that adds a binary dependency between them. Therefore their compilation and packaging requires a soma-forge development environment.

# Use standard recipes

In order to build packages from standard recipes, the `neuro-forge build` command can be used. To setup an environment for this command, one can use `git` and `pixi` with the following script:

```
git clone https://github.com/neurospin/neuro-forge
cd neuro-forge
pixi shell
```

Then, one or more packages can be built by using the following command.
```
neuro-forge build {output directory} {package} [{package}...]
```

For instance, to build a package for the latest `ldscore` release:
```
neuro-forge build /tmp/channel ldscore
```
