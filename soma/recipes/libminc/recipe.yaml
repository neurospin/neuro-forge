  summary: MINC - Medical Image NetCDF or MINC isn't netCDF.
  description: |
    The MINC file format is a highly flexible medical image file format
    built on the HDF5 generalized data format. The format is
    simple, self-describing, extensible, portable and N-dimensional, with
    programming interfaces for both low-level data access and high-level
    volume manipulation. On top of the libraries is a suite of generic
    image-file manipulation tools. The format, libraries and tools are
    designed for use in a medical-imaging research environment : they are
    simple and powerful and make no attempt to provide a pretty interface
    to users.
