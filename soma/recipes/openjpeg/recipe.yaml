    OpenJPEG is an open-source JPEG 2000 codec written in C language.
    It has been developed in order to promote the use of JPEG 2000, a still-image
    compression standard from the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG). Since
    April 2015, it is officially recognized by ISO/IEC and ITU-T as a JPEG 2000
    Reference Software.
