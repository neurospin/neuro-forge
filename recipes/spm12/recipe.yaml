  summary: |
    Analysis of brain imaging data sequences
  description: |
    The SPM software package has been designed for the analysis of brain
    imaging data sequences. The sequences can be a series of images from
    different cohorts, or time-series from the same subject.

    A standalone SPM is a version of SPM that has been compiled using
    the MATLAB Compiler so that it does not require the availability
    of a MATLAB licence.
