# Create the matlab-runtime package

Find more information in the [MATLAB Runtime](https://mathworks.com/help/compiler/matlab-runtime.html) MathWorks documentation.

The binaries are available starting from the [Download and Install MATLAB Runtime](https://mathworks.com/help/compiler/install-the-matlab-runtime.html) page.

We chose the official MATLAB Runtime Version numbers listed in the [MATLAB Runtime](https://mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html) download page, typically 9.7. Alternatives include v97 or R2019b. None of these versioning schemes account for updates (R2019b Update 9). Sigh.
